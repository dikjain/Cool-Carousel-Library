A collection of beautiful, customizable carousel components built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This project showcases different carousel animations and transitions that you can use in your web applications.

NOTE : I've used AI in this project to complete the README.md file as i don't have any experience in writing README.md files and also  i've taken the help of AI in 3D Carousels as im not very good at 3D animations.
